# Asteroid-Orbit-Determination

I wrote this code as part of an astrophysics research program, where my group studied the near-earth asteroid 2011 GA-62. This code takes in the data we collected
through both in-person and remote observatory observations and determines the asteroid's orbit over the next many thousand years. It also plots a diagram
showing this orbit, approximating if this asteroid has a possibility of hitting the earth at any point.
